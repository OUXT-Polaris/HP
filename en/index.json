What is RoboBoat? RoboBoat is an international competition for small autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) organized by RoboNation, held annually in March.\nIn this competition, participating teams design and construct their own hulls and integrate custom-developed control systems, sensors, and navigation algorithms to compete.\nThe vessels must operate fully autonomously and are required to complete various tasks during the competition.    OUXT Polaris has been participating in RoboBoat since last year. For more details, please refer to the article below:\nhttps://note.com/lush_bonobo1853/n/nc0a60b1aad72\nAdditionally, we received a special award at RoboBoat 2025.\n OUXT Polaris plans to participate in RoboBoat again this year\n     Small vessel built for the competition(2025)       Team members at work(2025)       Seeking sponsors The activities of OUXT Polaris are made possible through the support of our sponsors.\nWe are currently seeking sponsors to support our participation in RoboBoat and the Maritime RobotX Challenge.\nFor more details, please visit our Sponsorship
