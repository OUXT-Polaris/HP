OUXT Polaris requires funding for robot development, manufacturing, and transportation.  
Therefore, we are constantly seeking sponsors.  
If you have any questions, please feel free to [contact us](../../#contact).  
We are currently looking for sponsors through the end of **March 2026**.

## **Financial Sponsors**

OUXT Polaris needs financial support to purchase robot components and cover transportation expenses.  
We are looking for sponsors who can support us in this area.

## **In-Kind Sponsors**

At OUXT Polaris, we are developing fully autonomous ships using a variety of technologies and products.  
We will feature your products in blog posts tagged with your company name.  
If you lend us your products, we will count **half the value of the products** as sponsorship support.

If you are interested in supporting us, please feel free to [contact us](../../#contact).
