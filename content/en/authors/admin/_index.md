We are a student-led robotics team established to compete in the [Maritime RobotX Challenge](https://www.robotx.org/).  
For the 2025 season, we are participating in [RoboBoat](https://roboboat.org/), and we plan to compete in the 2026 tournament as well.
<br>
<br>
## What is **RoboBoat**?
RoboBoat is an international competition for small autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) organized by RoboNation, held annually in March.<br>
In this competition, participating teams design and construct their own hulls and integrate custom-developed control systems, sensors, and navigation algorithms to compete.<br>
The vessels must operate fully autonomously and are required to complete various tasks during the competition.

OUXT Polaris has been participating in RoboBoat since last year. For more details, please refer to the article below:

Additionally, we received a special award at RoboBoat 2025.<br>
