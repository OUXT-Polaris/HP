We are a student-led robotics team called '''OUXT Polaris''', which was formed for the [Maritime Robotx Challenge](https://www.robotx.org/).

The Maritime RobotX Challenge is one of the most advanced robotics competitions in the world.

{{< figure src="/img/about/ship.jpg" title="The ship during the tournament" class="center" width="450">}}

Each team develops control equipment, control systems, sensors, and algorithms, which are mounted on a hull called [WAM-V](http://www.wam-v.com/), and competes in the competition.
The ship must be fully automated and will be tasked with a variety of tasks during the competition.

The next conference will be held from December 12-19, 2020.
Would you like to work with us to build the world's smartest autopilot ship?
If you're interested, please [contact](./#contact) us!

The team is always looking for sponsors.
For more information, please check our [Call for Sponsors](./pages/call-sponsor) page.
